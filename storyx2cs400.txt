There once was a dragon named Paul who like donuts. Paul liked donuts so much he bought a bakery. He then served four thousand donuts to the people of Boston.
	The Boston police however, were very suspicious of paul. They suspected him to be apart of the dragon mafia. The dragon mafia controlled all the donut shops in Massachusetts. So it would make sense if Paul was implicated. Therefore, an investigation would be required.
