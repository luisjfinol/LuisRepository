There once was a dragon named Paul who like donuts. Paul liked donuts so much he bought a bakery. He then served four thousand donuts to the people of Boston.
	The Boston police however, were very suspicious of paul. They suspected him to be apart of the dragon mafia. The dragon mafia controlled all the donut shops in Massachusetts. So it would make sense if Paul was implicated. Therefore, an investigation would be required.
	The police tailed Paul for numerous days, watching his every move. It turns out that Paul was in fact apart of the dragon mafia. He was actually the infamous leader of the group.
The police now issue a warrant for the dragon's arrest. Paul, with inside information everywhere, must flee Boston. Paul quickly gathers his money and flees to across the world.
	After days of hiding, Paul with the help of his friend started his business and began doubling his donut count by day. Dragon mafia provide all accomodations and he planned every step. He got so close to ultimate success, until a new rival donut group had formed. They were known as the Donut Mafia. They were very gruesome people and would do anything for donuts.
